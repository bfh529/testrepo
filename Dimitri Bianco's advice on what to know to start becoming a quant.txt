I have been asked many times to provide a list of core topics or knowledge required to be a quant. As I have mentioned in the past, I believe being a quant is a continual process and not an end. Due to the infinite amount of topics that could be considered required base knowledge I have avoided writing this article and making the YouTube video for quite some time. The list below is only my opinion and has fairly general topics however I do believe these are some of the base areas that should be covered in a Masters quant or financial engineering program. These topics will change over time. Since I graduated 3 years ago, machine learning has become a required skill.

The three main areas of being a quant are math/statistics, computer science, and finance however I will have separate sections for math and stats.

Stats:
• Regression (OLS, GLM, Logistic, and etc.)
• Time-series (ARIMA, GARCH, ECM)
• Nonparametric Regression (Splines, Kernel, Locally Weighted Regression) 
• Data Exploration (Density Estimation, Normality Tests, Monte Carlo, Copulas
• Data Cleaning and Reduction (Cluster Analysis and Stats Theory)

Math:
• Calculus and Linear Algebra
• Optimization (Taylor Series, Markov Processes)
• ODE and PDE
• Stochastic Calculus (Martingales, Brownian Motion, Stochastic Integrals, Stochastic Differential Equations, Ito’s Lemma, Feynman-Kac)
• Binomial Asset Pricing

Computer Science:
• Stats Language (R, Python, SAS, Matlab, SPSS)
• Programming Language (Python, C++)
• Memory Management, Functions, Variables, Classes, Loops, If/Else Logic, Operators, Arrays, Reference and Pointers, best practices for writing code
• Implementation of math and stats knowledge in a program
• Machine Learning (Random Forest, Neural Networks, Decision Tree, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, Ensemble)

Finance:
• Equity (Stock Analysis, Diversification, Technical Analysis, Finance Theory)
• Fixed Income (Rate Curves, Pricing, Duration, TVM)
• Derivatives (Black Scholes, BDT, Stochastic Volatility Model, Volatility Smiles and Theory)
• Portfolio Optimization (CVaR, Efficient Frontier)
• Arbitrage Theory and Statistical Arbitrage
• Risk Management (VaR, Statistics, Credit Risk, Market Risk, Liquidity)

The topics above should be enough to start the journey of becoming a quant. Being a quant is a continual process and true quants will take the above as a starting point while continuing down different paths of interest. As you work in industry you will hone very specific skills however it is important to continue to explore other areas to strengthen your knowledge and to remain competitive in the job market.
